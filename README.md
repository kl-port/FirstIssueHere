# FirstIssueHere
A question for anyone who wants to get involved in an open-source project is where do we start? This project attempts to help you find the right first issue to start with. There are already many open-source projects, organizations and events that require people to contribute, but sometimes they need developers with relevant skills. Any contribution is suitable to start, including but not limited to: translating documentation, adding comments, fixing bugs in the code, adding new features to the project, participating in offline open-source activities. The important thing is to start solving the issue first, you can touch a lot of different things along the way.
